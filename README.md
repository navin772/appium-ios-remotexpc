# appium-ios-remotexpc

A Node.js library for interacting with iOS devices 
through Appium using remote XPC services. 
This library enables communication with iOS devices 
through various services like system logs and network tunneling.

## Overview

This library provides functionality for:

- Remote XPC (Cross Process Communication) with iOS devices
- Lockdown communication
- USB device multiplexing (usbmux)
- Property list (plist) handling
- Tunneling services to iOS devices
- System log access

## Installation

```bash
npm install appium-ios-remotexpc
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or later
- iOS device for testing
- Proper device pairing and trust setup

## Features

- **Plist Handling**: Encode, decode, parse, and create property lists for iOS device communication.
- **USB Device Communication**: Connect to iOS devices over USB using the usbmux protocol.
- **Remote XPC**: Establish Remote XPC connections with iOS devices.
- **Service Architecture**: Connect to various iOS services:
  - System Log Service: Access device logs
  - Tunnel Service: Network tunneling to/from iOS devices
- **Pair Record Management**: Read and write device pairing records.

## Usage

```typescript
import { TunnelService } from 'appium-ios-remotexpc';

// Create a tunnel to an iOS device
const tunnelService = new TunnelService();
await tunnelService.startService();

// Do operations with the tunnel
// ...

// Close the tunnel when done
await tunnelService.stopService();
```

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/appium-ios-remotexpc.git
cd appium-ios-remotexpc

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Dependabot for dependency management:

- **Lint and Build**: Automatically runs linting and builds the project on Node.js 20.x and 22.x
- **Format Check**: Ensures code formatting adheres to project standards
- **Test Validation**: Validates that test files compile correctly (actual tests require physical devices)
- **Dependabot**: Automatically creates PRs for dependency updates weekly

All pull requests must pass these checks before merging. The workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Scripts

- `npm run build` - Clean and build the project
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Run prettier
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm test` - Run tests (requires sudo privileges for tunneling)
